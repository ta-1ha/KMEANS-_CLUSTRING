# KMEANS-_CLUSTRING

🛒 Wholesale Market Segmentation using K-Means Clustering
This project applies unsupervised machine learning techniques to segment customers in a wholesale market using K-Means clustering. The dataset includes various product spending categories for clients, allowing us to discover natural groupings and customer behavior patterns.

📊 Project Overview
Goal: Identify customer segments in the wholesale market.

Technique: K-Means Clustering (Unsupervised Learning)

Dataset: Wholesale customers data (UCI Machine Learning Repository)

Toolkits: Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn

📁 Dataset Features
The dataset contains annual spending on the following categories:

Fresh

Milk

Grocery

Frozen

Detergents_Paper

Delicatessen

Channel (Hotel/Restaurant/Retail)

Region

⚙️ Steps Involved
Data Cleaning – Handling missing values and outliers.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Understanding distributions and relationships.

Feature Scaling – Normalization for K-Means performance.

Modeling – Applying K-Means clustering.

Evaluation – Using Elbow Method and Silhouette Score.

Visualization – Cluster representation in 2D/3D using PCA or t-SNE.

🛠️ Technologies Used
Python 3.x

NumPy

Pandas

Scikit-learn

Matplotlib

Seaborn

📈 Results
Identified distinct customer segments with similar purchasing behavior.

Visualized clusters to interpret customer types (e.g., Retail vs. Hotel clients).

Gained insights for targeted marketing or inventory management.
